# Data-Analysis-with-MLPQ

A through out data analysis on the immigration in the UK using MLPQ database which includes Data Transformations, Piecewise Linear Interpolation, SQl queries and animation with moving objects. 

## Getting Started

Download the mlpq_nt.exe files to run the analysis

## Deployment 
All the source code can be modify with any text editor for associated text files
* Data Used - immigration (1).txt
* Animation - animation1.txt

### Entity Diagram 
The entity diagram of all tables and relationships are available in Entity Diagram .docx

### Query 
In order to run the query, simply open up the immigration (1).txt with MLPQ and click on SQL icon at the top bar. Then, select associated types for the query and load the correct text files.
* HighestCountryInEveryContinent.txt - Aggregation SQL
* LondonForeignPopulation.txt - Basic SQL
* MainField.txt - Nested SQL
* MainReason.txt - Nested SQL
* Percentage.txt - Basic SQL

### Animation
To run the animation, you need to run the mlpq first and at the top bar click on open icon and select animation1.txt which will show a list of regions and countries's shape. Highlight all of the list and click on the play button. 


## Data Transformation 
All matlab scripts are available under the scirpts folder
### I2V2C
To create England Map by mapping jpeg image to coordinates.
### Piecewise Linear Interpolation
To predict the immigration growth rate in the future.
### Voronoi
To split diffrent regions in UK
